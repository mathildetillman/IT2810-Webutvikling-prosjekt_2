    "The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference. \n The opposite of art is not ugliness, it's indifference. \n The opposite of faith is not heresy, it's indifference. \n And the opposite of life is not death, it's indifference.",
    "Have you ever been in love? \n Horrible isn't it? \n It makes you so vulnerable. \n It opens your chest and it opens up your heart \n and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up.",
    "My mission in life is not merely to survive, \n but to thrive; \n and to do so with some passion, \n some compassion, \n some humor, \n and some style.",
    "The thing to do, it seems to me, \n is to prepare yourself so you can be a rainbow in somebody else's cloud. \n Somebody who may not look like you. \n May not call God the same name you call God \n - if they call God at all. \n I may not dance your dances or speak your language. \n But be a blessing to somebody. \n That's what I think."
