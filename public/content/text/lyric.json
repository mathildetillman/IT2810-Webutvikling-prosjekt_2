    "You played for me \n Youâ€…played for me, Oh-oh \n You played for me \n I swear it, even in my sleep \n I hear it like the memory \n Of everything we used to be",
    "I just keep on hopin' that you call me \n  You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now \n You never took the time to get to know me \n Was scared of losin' somethin' that we never found \n We're running out of reasons, but we can't let go \n Yeah, Hollywood is bleeding, but we call it home",
    "Seasons change and our love went cold \n Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go \n Run away, but we're running in circles \n Run away, run away \n I dare you to do something \n I'm waiting on you again \n So I don't take the blame \n Run away, but we're running in circles \n Run away, run away, run away"
